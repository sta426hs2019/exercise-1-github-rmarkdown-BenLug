## sample from a log-normal distribution

In the following code chunk we sample from a log normal dist and plot the sampled
values in a histogram.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
vals <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
hist(vals, main = "Histogram of the sample created from a log-normal dist") 
hist(log(vals), main = "Histgoram of the sample on a log scale")
```

## summary statistics for the sample

The empirical mean calculated from the data: `r mean(vals)`.\
The empirical variance equals `r var(vals)`.
