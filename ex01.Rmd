### exercise 01 b

In the following code chunk we sample from a log normal dist and plot the sampled
values in a histogram.

```{r}
vals <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
hist(vals) 
hist(log(vals))
```

The empirical mean calculated from the data: `r mean(vals)`.\
The empirical variance equals `r var(vals)`.
